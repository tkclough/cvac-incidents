# Incidents
I've done volunteer work for the Chappaqua Volunteer Ambulance Corps for some 
time that requires boring manual work. This module automates this work.

# TODO
- The classifier could still use some work; it's only about 75% accurate. This
  probably just means labeling some more data, as much of the error is on the
  more obscure types of calls.
